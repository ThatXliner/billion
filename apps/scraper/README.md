# Scraper CLI

The scraper collects government records and prepares the explanations the app reads. It writes directly to the selected database and can invoke paid providers. For the internal data flow, read [Scraper pipeline](../../docs/scraper.md). For production scheduling and deployment, read [Supervisor](../supervisor/README.md).

Commands below run from the repository root.

## Configure and run one source

```bash
pnpm env:setup --target scraper --scraper congress --file .env
pnpm env:doctor --target scraper --scraper congress --file .env
pnpm --filter @acme/scraper run start congress --max-items 1 --concurrency 1
```

Check the database target printed at startup. Local commands load root `.env.local` before `.env`, and existing process variables win. The doctor with `--file .env` validates that file; it does not prove a separate local override selects the same database. See [environment loading](../../docs/launch.md#loading-policy).

The first incremental Congress run starts at the beginning of the source feed. To inspect recent activity instead, use:

```bash
pnpm --filter @acme/scraper run start congress --recent 1 --concurrency 1
```

Source limits and generation budgets are different. `--max-items` limits source work in ordinary discovery; `--recent` selects a recent window. `SCRAPER_MAX_NEW_ITEMS_PER_RUN` limits items that generate assets, including existing records needing regeneration. Neither is a durable daily quota, and retry work has its own limits. Inspect `--help` and the source adapter before starting a larger job.

## Active sources

[The registry](src/scrapers.ts) defines what the CLI accepts and what `all` runs.

| CLI name            | Source                                                | Destination                               |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `whitehouse`        | White House presidential actions                      | `government_content`                      |
| `federalregister`   | Federal Register presidential documents               | `government_content`                      |
| `legistar`          | San José meetings, matters, documents, and votes      | Normalized `local_*` tables               |
| `congress`          | Congress.gov bills, text, summaries, and actions      | `bill`                                    |
| `open-states`       | State legislation through Open States                 | `bill`                                    |
| `scc-cvig`          | Santa Clara County voter-guide PDFs                   | Candidate statements in `civic_api_cache` |
| `ca-sos-statements` | California candidate-statement pages and PDF fallback | Candidate statements in `civic_api_cache` |

`all` starts registered scrapers concurrently and validates the whole set's environment first. It is broader than a production scheduled refresh. The supervisor names jobs separately so it can control timing, retention, and budgets.

`scotus.ts` is present but unregistered, so the current CLI does not accept `scotus`. Existing court content can still be read. Files under [scrapers/disabled](src/scrapers/disabled/README.md) are also inactive.

Each source declares its environment contract in an adjacent `*.config.ts`. Use those contracts and [the environment guide](../../docs/launch.md#scraper-and-scheduled-data-jobs) for required provider keys and current defaults.

## Build for production

```bash
pnpm --filter @acme/scraper build
node apps/scraper/dist/main.js congress --max-items 1 --concurrency 1
```

Vite writes Node ESM entries and shared chunks to `apps/scraper/dist/`. Deploy the whole directory and runtime dependencies. [vite.config.ts](vite.config.ts) lists the build entries; linked workspace source is bundled and third-party packages remain runtime dependencies.

Production entries read process variables and do not load local dotenv files. CI packages the build in `Dockerfile.scraper`; the [deployment guide](../supervisor/README.md) explains image pinning and the production host.

## Repair and backfill

Use the focused command for the missing asset. Check its help and preview mode first; write defaults differ by command.

| Command                      | Purpose                                                           |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `reprocess-content`          | Inspect or repair incomplete content; read-only until `--apply`   |
| `backfill-bill-descriptions` | Fill missing bill descriptions; writes require `--apply`          |
| `repair-bill-descriptions`   | Repair misleading bill summaries through a reviewed manifest      |
| `retroactive-briefs`         | Generate missing or stale structured briefs; supports `--dry-run` |
| `retroactive-lenses`         | Generate missing or stale perspectives; supports `--dry-run`      |
| `content-images`             | Generate header artwork                                           |
| `bill-interest`              | Score editorial interest; supports `--dry-run`                    |
| `prune-bills`                | Inspect retention candidates; read-only until `--apply`           |

For example:

```bash
pnpm --filter @acme/scraper retroactive-lenses --type bill --limit 1 --dry-run
```

For a bounded bill-description repair, inspect first, then generate a manifest
for review and apply only that manifest. The command reads stored bill sources;
it does not call congress.gov or regenerate briefs, lenses, or images.

```bash
pnpm --filter @acme/scraper repair-bill-descriptions --source congress.gov --limit 100
pnpm --filter @acme/scraper repair-bill-descriptions --source congress.gov --limit 100 --generate --output /tmp/bill-description-repairs.json
pnpm --filter @acme/scraper repair-bill-descriptions --apply --manifest /tmp/bill-description-repairs.json --yes
```

Use repeatable `--id` for a targeted repair. Inventory is read-only; generation
requires an explicit output path, and production apply requires `--yes`.

[Maintenance and reprocessing](../../docs/scraper.md#maintenance-backfill--reprocessing-scripts) explains write gates, source recovery, and retention behavior. The source hash and each asset's cache determine whether a rerun needs generation. `SCRAPER_FORCE_AI_REGEN=1` bypasses reuse, so use it only for an intentional regeneration.
